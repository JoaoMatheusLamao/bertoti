# Aula 1
We see three critical differences between programming and software engineering: time, scale, and the trade-offs at play. On a software engineering project, engineers
need to be more concerned with the passage of time and the eventual need for change. In a software engineering organization, we need to be more concerned about scale and
efficiency, both for the software we produce as well as for the organization that is producing it. Finally, as software engineers, we are asked to make more complex
decisions with higher-stakes outcomes, often based on imprecise estimates of time and growth. ("Engenharia de Software no Google")

Me arrisco a dizer que a engenharia de software é o coração de um projeto de software. Isto, pois os engenheiros que são responsáveis por tomar decisões de grande impacto no sistema, além de se preocupar com a qualidade e eficiência do projeto.
